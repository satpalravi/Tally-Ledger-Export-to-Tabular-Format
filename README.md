# Tally Ledger Export to Tabular Format

Streamlining Tally Ledger Export with Python. Unstructured to Structured Data

🔍 For a FP&A professional, Tally's exported ledger files, crucial for financial analytics, often lack structure, demanding manual effort for usability.

📁 Faced with unstructured data, I crafted a Python script to convert it into a structured format.

🔄 Python's Pandas and CSV libraries helped rearrange scattered data into a clear table.

⏱️ This automation saved hours of manual work, enhancing productivity significantly.
